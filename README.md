## Introduction

The Finance Complaint Classification model is designed to predict whether a person will file a complaint in the finance sector in the United States. This predictive capability can be invaluable for financial institutions, regulators, and other relevant stakeholders to proactively address potential issues, improve customer satisfaction, and streamline complaint management processes.

The classification model is developed using PySpark, a powerful framework for large-scale data processing and machine learning. It utilizes a dataset comprising historical finance complaint records to train and evaluate the model. The resulting model is then deployed as an API, allowing users to make real-time predictions by sending relevant data to the API endpoint.

The project also incorporates MLOps practices to ensure efficient model development, deployment, and management. MLOps encompasses various tools, techniques, and workflows to streamline the machine learning lifecycle, including version control, automated testing, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), model monitoring, and more. By leveraging MLOps, the project follows best practices in the industry and enables seamless collaboration between data scientists, developers, and operations teams.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- PySpark
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for exploring the dataset and training the model locally)
- MLOps tools (e.g., Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD platforms, monitoring tools, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
3. Make sure you have a PySpark environment set up on your machine. If not, follow the official PySpark installation guide: [PySpark Installation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/install.html)
4. Set up your MLOps tools and environments as per your organization's guidelines and requirements.

## Usage

To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. Prepare your dataset: Ensure you have a dataset containing relevant finance complaint records. The dataset should be in a format compatible with PySpark, such as CSV, JSON, or Parquet.

2. Train the model: Use the provided `train.py` script to train the classification model. Modify the script as necessary to fit your dataset and requirements. Run the following command to train the model:

3. Model Deployment and Inference: Deploy the trained model as an API using a containerization tool like Docker. This allows for easy scalability and portability. Use an orchestration tool like Kubernetes to manage the deployment and scaling of the API. Implement an API endpoint that accepts input data and returns predictions about whether a person will file a complaint or not.

4. MLOps Integration: Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to the code and model. Utilize CI/CD platforms to automate the testing, building, and deployment of the model API. Incorporate monitoring tools to track the model's performance and detect any anomalies or drifts.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the classification model consists of historical finance complaint records. It contains various features such as customer demographics, complaint details, financial product information, and more.

Please note that the dataset used in this repository is not provided, as it may be subject to privacy and licensing restrictions. You should prepare and format your own dataset in a similar fashion for training and evaluating the model.

## Model Training

To train the model, use the `train.py` script provided in the repository. Modify the script to fit your dataset and requirements. Run the following command to train the model:

The script will handle the training process using PySpark, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Model Deployment and Inference

The trained model can be deployed as an API using containerization tools like Docker. This allows for easy scalability and portability. Use an orchestration tool like Kubernetes to manage the deployment and scaling of the API. Implement an API endpoint that accepts input data and returns predictions about whether a person will file a complaint or not.

[Provide relevant code snippets or a separate README file explaining the model deployment and inference process.]

## Batch Prediction

To perform batch prediction using the trained model, use the `predict.py` script provided in the repository. Modify the script to fit your dataset and requirements. Run the following command to perform batch prediction:

The script will load the trained model and apply it to the input data to generate predictions.

## MLOps

This project incorporates MLOps practices to ensure efficient model development, deployment, and management. MLOps encompasses various tools, techniques, and workflows to streamline the machine learning lifecycle. Some key aspects of MLOps include:

- **Version Control**: Utilize a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to the code, notebooks, and model artifacts.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated tests to validate the correctness and performance of the code and the trained model.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Utilize CI/CD platforms (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) to automate the testing, building, and deployment of the model API.
- **Monitoring**: Incorporate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track the model's performance, detect anomalies or drifts, and trigger alerts when necessary.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use tools like Terraform or Kubernetes manifests to define the infrastructure required for running the model API.
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation for the project, including instructions for setting up the development environment, training the model, deploying the API, and any relevant workflows.
